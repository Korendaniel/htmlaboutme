	<p><b>My name is Daniel Koren, im 33 years old, and live in kibutz magal</b>.</p> <br/> I've always loved the sea, whether it's catching waves for hours with a boogie at the age of 6 or a sailing class at the age of 10, <br/>
	but what grabbed me the most was the diving course at the age of 14 that started in magical Sinai and ended on the amazing beaches of Eilat.<br/>After years of diving all along the shores of our beautiful country, I decided it was time to pack a bag and explore outside the borders of our country as well.</p>
	<br/>First destination Thailand to an island called Koh Tao where I did a course called Divemaster which is the first course in a training courses to become an instructor
	and the duration of the course is a month and a half, which did not prevent me from continuing for another two months beyond the course on this magical island<br/>that for 3 years in a row I returned to the island from January to April to meet friends
	from all over the world<br/>who like me, could not detach themselves from the magic that this island has to offer.<p/>
	<br/>I started taking pictures because a friend that organizes diving trips said we flying to Mozambique to a fishing village called Tofo
	to photograph a humpback whale<br/>and since the friend is a great photographer, I was convinced that this is an excellent way to experience diving.<br/>As luck as i could be, the trip also took place on my birthday, so I spoiled 
	Myself with a camera and a waterproof case<br/> that allows scuba diving and the rest is history.<br/>Since then I managed to dive in Mexico on an island far away from the coast, a full day of sailing away called Socorro to photograph<br/>the magical great manta-ray, far far away but worth every second<br/>of sailing because what happened
	there kept only for the best dreams of every diver in the world.<p/><br/>Unfortunately, about a year after the trip to Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic entered our lives, which luckily made me understand<br/>until the next trip
	Let's focus on what we have here in our small country, a few hours from our door, maybe a little traffic, but an infinite<br/> charm that is very difficult to describe.<p/><br/>"The happiness of the bee and the dolphin is to exist. For man it is to know that and to wonder at it." - Jacques Yves Cousteau
