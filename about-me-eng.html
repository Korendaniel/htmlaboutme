	<h4 class="abouteng" style="font-size:1.5vmax;">
	<p>My name is Daniel Koren, im 33 years old, and live in kibutz magal.</p> I've always loved the sea, whether it's catching waves for hours with a boogie at the age of 6 or a sailing class at the age of 10. <br/>
	but what grabbed me the most was the diving course at the age of 14 that started in magical Sinai<br/> and ended on the amazing beaches of Eilat.<br/>After years of diving all along the shores of our beautiful country, I decided it was time to pack a bag<br/> and explore outside the borders of our country as well.</p>
	First destination Thailand to an island called Koh Tao where I did a course called "Divemaster" which is the first course in a training courses to become an instructor
	and the duration of the course is a month and a half, which did not prevent me from stay for another<br/> two months beyond the course on this magical island,<br/>that for 3 years in a row I returned to the island from January to April to meet friends
	from all over the world<br/>who like me, could not detach themselves from the magic that this island has to offer.<p/>
	I started taking pictures because a friend that organizes diving trips said we flying to Mozambique to a fishing village<br/> called Tofo
	to photograph a humpback whale<br/>and since the friend is a great photographer, I was convinced that this is an excellent way to experience diving.<br/>As luck as i could be, the trip also took place on my birthday, so I spoiled 
	Myself with a camera and a waterproof case<br/> that allows scuba diving and the rest is history.<p>Since then I managed to dive in Mexico on an island far away from the coast, a full day of sailing away called Socorro to photograph<br/>the magical great manta-ray, far far away but worth every second<br/>of sailing because what happened
	there kept only for the best dreams of every diver in the world.<p/>Unfortunately, about a year after the trip to Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic entered our lives, which luckily made me understand<br/>until the next trip
	Let's focus on what we have here in our small country, a few hours from our door, maybe a little traffic, but an infinite<br/> charm that is very difficult to describe.
